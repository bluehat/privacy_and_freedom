#Air Notes

Doug notes and made a list. I asked for a copy because I think he would take good notes and write good lists.

##Notes
* On face things: The typical safety standards for wildfire is n95- n100 or P95-p100. The difference between P and N is that P is also oil resistant. Notice this only filters out particles and not gasses like CO, or CO2.The problem with the cheaper masks is you need good face contact. P95 masks are strictly better than N95 masks except harder to breathe in casually.
* On room things: You need to allow the same air to circulate through the purifier more than once preferably in a closed room. Each pass removes 95% of the particles
###Current guess at Amazon with Saturday delivery:
* [Air Mask](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00079FOK0/)
** This one is P, the heavier and harder to breathe through one). This is not because we're sure P is the correct but because this is the one that was on hand origionally. Doug says he can breathe through it and it is just uncomfortable to physically have on your face.
** Also excellent for obnoxious Bane impressions
